> **Opinionated Self-Hosting Platform** - Deploy a complete stack of open-source services with built-in authentication and HTTPS

## Vision

Blueprint is an opinionated deployment tool for self-hosting enthusiasts who want to run their own services without the complexity of configuring authentication, reverse proxies, and containerization from scratch.

Every service deployed with Blueprint:
- ‚úÖ Routes through **Caddy** (automatic HTTPS, subdomains)
- ‚úÖ Protected by **Authelia** (Single Sign-On, 2FA)
- ‚úÖ Runs as **systemd containers** (Podman)
- ‚úÖ Shares **unified secret management**
- ‚úÖ Follows **production-ready defaults**

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g blueprint

# Create a new deployment
blueprint init --name my-platform

# Automatically set up systemd links and start services
# (Blueprint will prompt to do this during init)

# Or manually start core services
blueprint services start authelia-postgres authelia caddy

# Add verbose logging for debugging
blueprint -v services logs authelia
```

## Core Infrastructure

Blueprint provides an opinionated stack with two essential services that power everything else:

### üîí Caddy (Reverse Proxy)
- Automatic HTTPS with Let's Encrypt
- Subdomain routing for all services
- Zero-config SSL certificates
- Modern HTTP/3 support

### üõ°Ô∏è Authelia (Authentication/Authorization)
- Single Sign-On (SSO) for all services
- Multi-factor authentication (TOTP 2FA)
- User and group management
- Session management across services
- PostgreSQL backend (auto-configured)
- Advanced secret management with podman integration

## Features

- **Zero Decision Fatigue** - Authentication, routing, and containerization are pre-configured
- **Production Ready** - Security best practices and sensible defaults built-in
- **Consistent Patterns** - Every service follows the same deployment model
- **Easy Scaling** - Add new services with a single command
- **Unified Management** - One tool to control your entire self-hosted infrastructure
- **Advanced Secret Management** - Integrated podman secrets with mixed file-based and environment variable approaches

## Installation

### Global Installation (Recommended)
```bash
npm install -g blueprint
```

### Development Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jameswhayman/blueprint.git
cd blueprint
npm install
npm run build
npm run link  # For development
```

## CLI Commands

### Initialize Platform
```bash
blueprint init --name my-platform --domain example.com
```

### Service Management
```bash
# List all services
blueprint services list

# Start/stop/restart services
blueprint services start <service>
blueprint services stop <service>
blueprint services restart <service>

# View logs
blueprint services logs <service> -f
```

### User Management
```bash
# Add users to your platform
blueprint auth add-user --username john --email john@example.com

# List platform users
blueprint auth list-users
```

### Domain Routing
```bash
# Route subdomain to a service
blueprint domain add --domain app.example.com --target http://localhost:3000

# List configured domains
blueprint domain list
```

### Secrets Management
```bash
# Interactive setup for platform secrets
blueprint secrets setup

# View current secrets (debugging)
blueprint secrets show
```

## Architecture

When you initialize a Blueprint deployment, it creates:

```
my-platform/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ containers/           # Container definitions
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ *.container      # systemd container units
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ *.volume         # Volume definitions
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Caddyfile        # Caddy routing configuration
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ authelia-config/ # Authelia configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backups/             # Automatic backups during setup
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user/               # User systemd units
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ *.socket        # Socket activation units
```

## systemd Management

Blueprint uses systemd containers (Podman) for orchestration:

```bash
# Start services (as user, not root)
systemctl --user start caddy.container
systemctl --user start authelia.container

# Enable auto-start on boot
systemctl --user enable caddy.container
systemctl --user enable authelia.container

# View logs
journalctl --user -u caddy.container -f
```

## Security Features

- **Podman secret management** with mixed file-based and environment variable approaches
- **Argon2id password hashing** for user credentials
- **Rate limiting** and brute-force protection
- **Secure session management** with automatic expiry
- **TLS 1.2+ enforcement** for all communications
- **HTTPS-only by default** with automatic certificate management
- **Automatic certificate renewal** via Let's Encrypt
- **Container isolation** with systemd security features

## Recent Updates (v1.2.10)

üîß **Major Authelia Configuration Overhaul**
- Fixed all Authelia configuration issues and startup errors
- Implemented proper secret management with podman integration
- Updated networking from pasta to podman bridge for inter-container communication
- Streamlined deployment structure (removed unnecessary secrets directory)
- Added verbose mode (`-v`) for detailed debugging output
- Automatic deployment setup during initialization

üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Improvements**
- Mixed secret approach: file-based for sensitive data, environment variables for configuration
- Reduced secret count from 11 to 10 optimized secrets
- Fixed container networking for proper hostname resolution
- Updated to latest Authelia 4.39+ environment variable format
- Removed deprecated configuration options

## Roadmap

### Coming Soon: Service Marketplace

Blueprint will support one-command deployment of popular self-hosted services:

#### TODO: Services to Add
- [ ] **Listmonk** - Newsletter and mailing list manager
- [ ] **Twenty CRM** - Modern CRM alternative to Salesforce
- [ ] **Umami** - Privacy-focused analytics alternative to Google Analytics
- [ ] **OpenReplay** - Session replay and debugging platform

#### Future Services
- [ ] **Nextcloud** - File sync and collaboration
- [ ] **GitLab** - Complete DevOps platform
- [ ] **Grafana** - Monitoring and observability
- [ ] **Vaultwarden** - Password manager
- [ ] **Jellyfin** - Media server
- [ ] **PhotoPrism** - AI-powered photo management
- [ ] **Paperless-ngx** - Document management
- [ ] **Home Assistant** - Home automation

Each service will be pre-configured to work seamlessly with Caddy and Authelia, requiring minimal configuration from the user.
